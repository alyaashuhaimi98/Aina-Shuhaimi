<blockquote>As everyone likes to believe that their father is different, so do I. Nonetheless, this conviction is not merely based on the love I have for him, but also because of his personality. My father is retired army and he’s quite disciplined in all aspects of life. He is the one who taught me to always practice discipline no matter what work I do. Most importantly, he has a jovial nature and always makes my mother laugh with his silly antics even after 29 years of marriage. I completely adore this silly side of him when he is with his loved ones. He tries his best to fulfil all our wishes but also maintains the strictness when the need arises. I can proudly say that it is my father who has been my source of inspiration from day one. In other words, his perspective and personality together have shaped me as a person. Similarly, he has a great impact on the world as well in his own little ways.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My mother is an ordinary woman she is my superhero. In every step of my, she supported and encouraged me. Whether day or night she was always there for me no matter what the condition is. Furthermore, her every work, persistence, devotion, dedication, conduct is an inspiration for me. In this essay on my mother, I am going to talk about my mother and why she is so special to me. I love her not because she is my mother and we should respect our elders. I respect her because she has taken care of me when I was not able to speak. At that time, she has taken care of all my needs when I wasn’t able to speak. Additionally, she taught me how to walk, speak, and take care of myself. Similarly, every bigger step that I have taken in my life is all because of my mother. Because, if she hasn’t taught me how to take small steps then I won’t be able to take these bigger step.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Brothers aren’t simply close; brothers are knit together”~ Robert Rivers. Siblings are more like friends who never leave us alone. The brother-sister bond is a special one. Even though they constantly argue, they share a deep friendship, and this friendship is the best thing one can ever ask for. He helps me in many way. Sometime we always share our thoughts together. Honestly, if we apart from this world I will definitely missing them so much.</blockquote>
